## Surfs_up

### Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a statistical analysis for the weather in the island of Oahu. This analysis is required for attaining a significant amount of investment for fullfiling our dream of opening a surfing and ice-cream shop in the island. To get this investment, our investor W. Avy has tasked us to present a weather analysis for June and December. The invetor is skeptic because one of his earlier investments failed because of the weather. This will also help determine whether or not the surf and ice-cream shop business is sustainable year-round, and we can collect informations such as average, max, & min temperatures.

### Results

based on our analysis, it can be concluded that, after completing 1700 observation in June and 1500 in December, there is a very low standard deviation, which implies that there is not a significant changes in weather across the years. 
This seems logical as it is an Island and the weather and temperature in an Island are always consistent, throughout the year.
####Temperature differences:
1. June is a bit warmer than December.
2. maximum temperature difference is 2 degrees
3. minimum temperature is 8.

###Summary
Although, after comparing two months, we can conclude that temperature patterns remain steady throughout the year, to get a better understanding of the weather on Oahu we can conduct two more queries. 
1. Rainfall - Although temperatures may remain the same throughout the year, rainfall may not and can have a significant impact on the business because most beaches do not allow surfing when there is a heavy rain.
2. Location - We can create another querie that compares the most active location versus the weather patterns. This can help us target the location that is mostly preferd by the tourists.
